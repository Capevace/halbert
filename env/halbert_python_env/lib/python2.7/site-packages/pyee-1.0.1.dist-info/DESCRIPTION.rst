pyee
======

pyee supplies an event_emitter object that acts similar to the `EventEmitter`
that comes with node.js.

Example
-------

::

    In [1]: from pyee import EventEmitter

    In [2]: ee = EventEmitter()

    In [3]: @ee.on('event')
       ...: def event_handler():
       ...:     print 'BANG BANG'
       ...:

    In [4]: ee.emit('event')
    BANG BANG

    In [5]:

Easy-peasy.

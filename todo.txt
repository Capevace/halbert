- Rewrite setState/getState to state.get/.set
- Supply custom builder functions for module interaction ('runAction' etc)
- refactor scss
- add possibility to pass output from trigger to action
- somehow fix unlistening triggers
- add module pages (maybe popups or separate pages) so they can have global settings.
  This would enable modules that act in background but still require easily editable config.
